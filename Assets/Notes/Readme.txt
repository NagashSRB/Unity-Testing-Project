TestingModels scene

Scene for testing 3rd party or personal models, rendering, graphics performance and number of triangles 

-HydrantTest1 - My first blender model from youtube clip, with 2 materials and light settings in blender
-Problem: unity scale, object size, triangles, performance

-HydrantTest2 - Turned off lighting in blender, small improvement. I dont know if its worth it

-HydrantTest3 - No material , reduced number of triangles a lot.


Conclusion:
-With turned off Directional Light in Unity, no material and light in blender, number of triangles are fine
